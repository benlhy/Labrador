Welcome to the GitHub page for the Golden Retriever! This repo converts the design files into Eagle files as well as changes the original layout of the EspoTek Labrador to achieve a form that fits the breadboard better. For the build instructions, please visit the EspoTek Labrador Github page.

The PCB files were done in Eagle 7.7
